      About : Trishanya is a non-profit online donation platform which aims to
      channel and provide resources to credible non-governmental organisations
      across India. As a web portal, it helps raise funds and contributions from
      individuals across India and the world and then disburses these donations
      to credible Indian NGOs.
    </p>
    <p class="cntr">
      Idea: This platform helps the people in finding various social causes
      which require most attention at that time. Also, people willing to donate
      can filter their searches with respect to a particular cause. This
      platform keeps the track of the amount donated by each donor and shows his
      or her share in making lives of the people better, which further motivates
      the donor to donate and spread awareness in public about it.
    </p>

    <p class="cntr">
      How it works: Trishanya does not undertake any charitable functions
      directly. Instead, it channels funds provided by donors to certified
      non-profit organizations across India. Non-profit organizations who wish
      to partner with Trishanya need to satisfy a minimum set of conditions
      known as "credibility alliance norms." Among other criteria, organizations
      must have no political ties and at least fifty percent of their
      beneficiaries must be economically underprivileged. Donors visit Trishanya
      website and donate online to their preferred Indian NGOs and the donations
      are then disbursed to those NGOs.
    </p>
    <p class="cntr">
      Motive: Our motive is to make it easier for people to search for reliable
      NGOs where they can donate for the betterment of the society. Also, we aim
      to improve the condition of our country so that we can contribute towards
      the success and growth of our country.
